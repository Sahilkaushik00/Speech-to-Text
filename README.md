Project Title: Whisper ASR Transcription System

Overview:
The Whisper ASR Transcription System is a Python-based application that leverages OpenAI's Whisper Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to transcribe both real-time microphone input and uploaded audio files. This versatile system provides users with the flexibility to transcribe spoken language seamlessly, whether it be through a live microphone or pre-recorded audio files.

Key Features:

Real-time Microphone Input:

Users can opt for real-time transcription by selecting the microphone input option.
The system utilizes the system's default microphone to capture live audio and transcribes it using the Whisper ASR model.
Exception handling is incorporated to manage scenarios such as no speech detected or recognition errors.
File Upload Option:

Users have the choice to upload audio files for transcription.
The system prompts users to provide the file path, enabling them to transcribe pre-recorded conversations, interviews, or any audio content of interest.
Exception handling ensures smooth processing and user-friendly error messages.
Dynamic User Interface:

The system presents users with a menu interface, allowing them to easily choose between real-time microphone input and file upload options.
Users are guided through the process, making it accessible and straightforward.
